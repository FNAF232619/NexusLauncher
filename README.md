# NexusLauncher
This is the official Nexus launcher for Windows. It shows many clients similar to Ambrossial, only it is updated. :) It can happen if you use Avast or similar programs that block the launcher. It is not a virus! Create an exception for it. 
I hope you like my first app! I spent a long time working on it and will update it at least once a month. The mentioned clients can lead to the loss of your account and violate Minecraft's terms of service.
